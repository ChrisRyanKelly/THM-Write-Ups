## Repository Contents

### Write-Ups
Each folder corresponds to a specific challenge or room, containing:
- **Step-by-step guides** detailing reconnaissance, exploitation, and privilege escalation.
- **Code snippets** for scripts or payloads used during the process.
- **Command breakdowns** to explain the tools and techniques applied.

### Scripts and Tools
Custom scripts and tools developed for specific challenges are included in the repository. These scripts are designed to:
- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Enhance exploitation workflows.
- Provide a deeper understanding of vulnerabilities and their exploitation.

## Purpose
This repository serves two main purposes:
1. **Education**: To provide an alternative write-up experience that encourages hands-on learning and independent flag discovery.
2. **Skill Development**: To document my journey in scripting, exploit development, and penetration testing, and to share useful tools and techniques with the community.
